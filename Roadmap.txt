For our Roadmap we want to group our issues into different sprints.

The first sprint will contain issues 1, 2, 8, 9, and 11, as they are the basics of our program, dealing with account and user implementations.
The second sprint will contain issues 3, 5, 10, 16, and 20, and will revolve around general playlist generation and editing.
The third sprint will contain issues 4, 6, 12, 17, and 18, and will deal with customizable generation/insights.
The fourth sprint will contain issues 7, 13, 14, 15, and 20, and will handle privacy and notification settings, cross platform logistics, and accesibility needs.
