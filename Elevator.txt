Product Vision: 

Our product is a better spotify. Users will log in with their already made spotify premium accounts and we will be able to get their data from Spotify themselves.
From there, they will be able to see their own data with a better visual with tracked stats. Users will be able to create spotify playlists directly from our website
based on their previous listening statistics based on genre, artist, or type of music. Since they aren't making new logins for our website specifically, we will not be
storing any user data in order to protect our users. Theoretically, someone can log in to our application, check out their listening history for the past month and 
make a playlist based on all of the songs that they played in the last month and listen to that playlist within a short period of time of being on our web application.
